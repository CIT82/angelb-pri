**Div Usage**:
- The template heavily relies on `div` containers to structure the layout, using Bootstrap’s grid system with classes like `container-fluid`, `row`, and `col-*`. This gives a responsive design.
- I noticed that nearly every section is wrapped in a `div` container, with additional inner containers for items like text, images, and buttons.
