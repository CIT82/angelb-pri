## CSS

Play Around
Give understanding of CSS

What is a class?

Classes in CSS are specific elements that are selected! 
- You can use the same class on multiple elements! 
- When using, make sure a dot is present (ex: .red)
- Using classes with java is handy since you can manipulate elements! 

## Review
- mdn display
    - Display property is how element is displayed on page
         - block, inline, flex, grid are examples
         - block taxes up fill width of line
         - inline only takes needed space
         - flex enables a flexable layout

- responsive design
    - Responsive design is how we make websites look good on different devices/screens!
        - Fluid Layout: flex grids (percentages)
        - Media queries: apply styles based on screen size
        - Flex images: images adjust based on screen size
        - Viewport meta tag:
        Correct scaling on mobile devices
        - Test across devices: Checks how the design looks on tablets, phones, and desktops!
