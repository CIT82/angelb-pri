# What Is the Internet?

The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computers that allows for the sharing and exchange of information. It’s the backbone of our digital world, enabling everything from simple emails to complex data transfers across continents.

### A Brief History
- **Nikola Tesla** (1900s): Early ideas of a global wireless communication system.
- **ARPANet**: The precursor to the internet, a project by the US Department of Defense for real-time communication between computers.
- **DARPA**: The agency behind ARPANet, focusing on advanced research projects.
- **Packet Switching**: A method where messages are broken into packets and sent independently from one point to another. Early packet switching was unreliable due to delays.
- **TCP/IP**: The protocols that ensure data is correctly ordered and delivered to its destination.
- **ICANN**: The body that coordinates unique identifiers, like domain names, ensuring devices can communicate across the internet. Think of ICANN as the traffic controllers of the web, managing the flow of data.

# Who Invented the Internet?

- **Paul Mockapetris**: Invented the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses.
- **Tim Berners-Lee**: Invented the World Wide Web. He addressed the problem of scientists being unable to share information by creating **Hypertext**, leading to the development of **HTML**, **HTTP**, and **URI**.

# How Does the Internet Work?

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: The language used to create and structure web pages.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol that allows web pages to be fetched and viewed from linked resources across the web.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: The unique address used to identify each resource on the web.

In 1993, these technologies were pushed to the public through the **W3C** (World Wide Web Consortium), leading to the open and largely uncensored internet we know today.

# The Internet Today

### By the Numbers
- **4.7 Billion** Internet users worldwide.
- **293 Billion** emails sent every day.
- **1,157%** increase in internet usage from 2000 to 2020.
- In 2009, less than 1% of internet traffic came from mobile devices; today, over **51%** of global traffic is mobile.

### Infrastructure
- There are **500 million miles** of undersea cables connecting the world. These cables are the physical foundation of the internet, enabling the seamless global communication we rely on.

# What’s Next for the Internet?

- Companies like **Google** and **Facebook** are working on creating **wireless internet** solutions, pushing towards a more connected and accessible digital world for everyone.
