# What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is using the internet to store and manage data on remote servers. You’re probably using it without realizing, like when sending emails or streaming music.

### Hosting
Online services (like games or websites) need to be hosted somewhere, either by setting up your own server or using a cloud provider.

## Types of Cloud Services

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
You rent servers and storage from a provider, paying only for what you use. The provider takes care of the hardware.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
A service that gives developers tools to build and manage apps, without worrying about servers or hardware.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
You use software over the internet, usually through a web browser, without needing to install anything. The provider handles everything like updates and security.

## On-Premises vs Cloud

- **On-premises**: You manage everything (hardware, servers, etc.) yourself, in your own building.
- **Cloud**: You let a cloud provider handle some or all of that, so you don’t have to deal with it.

## Things to Consider

- When picking a cloud service, think about cost, security, and how much control you want.
- You can choose between ready-made services or customize one to fit your needs.

## Recap

- Cloud computing delivers services like servers and storage over the internet.
- Three main types: **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**.
- Choose a service based on cost, security, and your business needs.
- You can either use off-the-shelf solutions or customize your cloud setup.

# Cloud Provider
I chose to do more research on Gooogle Cloud (GCP), since I use google all the time and was interested. GCP provides a wide range of services, including compute, storage, machine learning, AI, and big data analytics! Some strengths it has is its high avaliability, advanced AI/ML tools, and its excellent documentation and user support. These strengths allow GCP to thrive in use cases like machine learning projects, large-scale web applications, and businesses with operations... However, there are some weaknesses. The smaller service catalog makes it so it limits the choices for users that are seeking more specialized cloud tools. Compared to its competitors like AWS, the lack of services makes it less ideal. GCP's pricing can also be difficult to understand and might lead to unexpected costs and make budgeting harder for businesses.
