## How Google Works
- Google uses something called the Quality Rater Guidelines (QRG), a guide that shows what makes a website "perfect."
- They hire actual people to check websites. See how well they meet standards.
- What’s important => Google wants to provide the best search results possible. If your site follows the guidelines, you’re more likely to rank higher.

## Relevance
- Relevance is the most important factor... Your content has to match what people are searching for!
- If someone searches => how to fix a car and you write about cats, it won’t rank because it’s not relevant to the search.
- **Search Intent**: Figuring out what question someone is asking and then writing the best answer to that question.
- Use Google’s autosuggest feature and the “related searches” at the bottom of search results to find what people really search for.

## On-page SEO
- On-page SEO refers to what you do directly on your website to improve rankings.
- **Content Length**: Match the depth of your content to the search query. Some questions need short answers, others need in-depth.
- They recommend writing three types of blog posts:
- - Response posts (~1,250 words): These answer very specific questions.
- - Staple posts (~2,200 words): More detailed articles.
- - Pillar posts (~3,500 words): In-depth articles that cover a broad topic.

## Off-page CEO
- Off-page SEO is about building your site’s reputation from outside sources, like backlinks.
- Focus on creating great content. If your content is useful--> people will naturally link to it --> helps build your site’s reputation.
- Promote your blog on social media, YouTube, or places like Reddit and Pinterest.
